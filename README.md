## How to compile

1. Get ns-allinone-2.31.tar.gz and extract it
2. Install git, e.g. in Debian: ```sudo apt-get install git```
3. Clone this repository: ```git clone git://github.com/abdulla-alali/TFRC-CR.git -b CRAHN```
4. You'll end up with a ns-2.31 clone that has the CRAHN module integrated. Replace the ns-2.31 subfolder 
(from the ns-allinone file that you already extracted) with the one you cloned from here.
5. ```./configure``` and then ```make```
